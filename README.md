Additionally, hovering over the quote changes its color to blue, and clicking on the quote logs each character of the quote to the console.

## Event Listeners:
New Quote Button Click- When the "New Quote" button is clicked, an event listener triggers the updateQuote function to fetch and display a new quote.
Mouse over -When the mouse hovers over the quote, its color changes to blue.
Mouse out -When the mouse moves away from the quote, its color reverts to black.
